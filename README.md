# 🔐 Authentication

Authentication is implemented using **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**.

Workflow:

1. User logs in
2. Server generates JWT token
3. Token stored in browser
4. Token sent with each API request
5. Backend validates the token

---

# 📡 Real-Time Features

Real-time order updates are implemented using **SignalR**.

Order Status Flow:

```
Placed → Processing → Shipped → Delivered
```

Users can see order status updates instantly without refreshing the page.

---

# 📧 Email Notifications

The system sends order confirmation emails using **Mailtrap SMTP service**.

Emails are sent when:

* Order is successfully placed
* Order confirmation is generated

---

# 💳 Payment Integration

The system is designed to support payment gateway integration such as:

* Razorpay
* Paypal

(Currently configured for development/testing)
